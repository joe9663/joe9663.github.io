<h1>Die Hard</h1>
<header>Die Hard is one of the best action movies ever made.</header>
<p>John McClane, the hero of this story, is the reason that this movie is an action film classic.  He is a seemingly normal police officer from New York that is put in an extraordinary situation which he then has to fix in order to save the day.</p>
<div>
<p>This is a picture of the amazing hero in question.

<p>The first Die Hard movie is much better than any of the following ones because the sequels did away with the story elements that made the movie great.</p>
<header>What made the first Die Hard great?</header>
<ul>
	<li>One location</li>
	<li>Reluctant hero</li>
	<li>Confusion</li>
</ul>
<h2>Die Hard by the numbers</h2>
<p>The first Die Hard also had less gratuitous violence and murder than the susequent movies.  A high body count does not necessarily make a better action movie.</p>

<p><a href="http://diehard.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page">This</a> is the website that the information about the Die Hard body counts was obtained from.  This website is way better than the one I made because it has links to so much other content and I much more organized.  The site has extensive use of div tags to break up content into more managable chunks.
